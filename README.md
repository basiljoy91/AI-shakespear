## Project Overview

This project implements a character-level recurrent neural network that learns patterns from Shakespeare's writings and generates original text in a similar style. The model uses LSTM layers to capture long-term dependencies in the text data.

**Key Components**:
- Character-level text processing
- LSTM-based sequence modeling
- Temperature-controlled sampling
- Beam search decoding

**Technology Stack**:
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras API
- NumPy for numerical operations
- tqdm for progress bars

**Dataset**: Contains approximately 1MB of Shakespeare's works including plays and sonnets.
